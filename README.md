# CapitalBikeShareZillowProject1

Tha main code can be found in CapitalBikeShareMaster.ipynb.

The StationListGeneration.py was run locally on 20+ CSVs that are not shown in the main code. This is to prevent cluttering in the Repo and also because the files are very large and would have to be split up in order to upload. The output of this code is the CapitalBikeShareDF.csv, which is used as the base CSV for our analysis.
